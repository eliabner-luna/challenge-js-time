# challenge-js-time
The code changes the page title to "Challenge time" and defines four functions: consoleButton (logs a message to the console), alertButton (shows an alert with "I love JS!"), promptButton (asks for a Brazilian city and shows an alert with the chosen city), and sumButton (sums two numbers and displays the result in an alert).
